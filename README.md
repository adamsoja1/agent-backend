# Agentic Framework

A small Python framework for building streaming LLM agents with tools, skills, and multi-agent crew delegation.

## What Is Included

- **Agents**: async streaming agents backed by an OpenAI-compatible client.
- **Tools**: Python callables exposed to the model as OpenAI tool schemas.
- **Skills**: grouped toolsets that an agent can activate during a run.
- **Conversations**: event-based message history converted to OpenAI-compatible messages.
- **Crews**: orchestration for multiple agents with delegation or ask-only collaboration.
- **Streaming events**: typed events for text deltas, tool calls, tool results, delegation, errors, and final answers.

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adamsoja1/agent-backend.git
```

Install a tagged version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adamsoja1/agent-backend.git@v0.1.0
```

Install for local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamsoja1/agent-backend.git
cd agent-backend
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

When the package is published to PyPI:

```bash
pip install agentic-framework
```

## Configuration

`Agent` uses an `AsyncOpenAI`-compatible client. You can pass a client explicitly, which is recommended:

```python
import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    base_url=os.getenv("LLM_PROVIDER", "https://ollama.com/v1"),
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "EMPTY"),
)
```

If you do not pass `client=...`, the framework creates a default `AsyncOpenAI` client using:

- `LLM_PROVIDER`, defaulting to `https://ollama.com/v1`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, defaulting to `EMPTY`

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from agentic_framework import Agent
from agentic_framework.core.stream_events import TextDeltaEvent, FinalAnswerEvent
from agentic_framework.tools.base import tool


@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a city."""
    return f"Weather in {city}: rainy"


agent = Agent(
    name="assistant",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt="You are a concise assistant.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)


async def main() -> None:
    async for event in agent.stream("What is the weather in London?"):
        if isinstance(event, TextDeltaEvent):
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif isinstance(event, FinalAnswerEvent):
            print(f"\nFinal answer: {event.answer}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

For a non-streaming convenience wrapper:

```python
answer = await agent.invoke("What is the weather in London?")
```

## Tools

Decorate a Python function with `@tool` to expose it to an agent. The function name becomes the tool name, the docstring becomes the description, and type hints are used to build a JSON schema.

```python
from agentic_framework.tools.base import tool


@tool
def get_user_items(user: str) -> str:
    """List items owned by a user."""
    return f"Items for {user}: laptop, phone, keys"
```

You can also override the generated name and description:

```python
@tool(name="lookup_items", description="Look up a user's items.")
def get_user_items(user: str) -> str:
    return f"Items for {user}: laptop, phone, keys"
```

Supported primitive schema mappings are `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, and `dict`. Unknown or complex annotations fall back to `"string"`.

## Skills

Skills group tools behind an activation tool. A skill named `"research"` is exposed as `skill_research`; when activated, its tools are added to the agent's available tools until another skill is activated or the skill is deactivated internally.

```python
from agentic_framework.tools.base import BaseTool, Skill


search_tool = BaseTool(
    name="search_docs",
    description="Search internal docs.",
    func=lambda query: f"Results for {query}",
)

research_skill = Skill(
    name="research",
    description="Use when the task needs document research.",
    tools=[search_tool],
)

agent = Agent(
    name="assistant",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    skills=[research_skill],
)
```

## Conversations

`Conversation` stores events, not just plain messages. `get_messages()` converts the visible events into OpenAI-compatible message dictionaries.

```python
from agentic_framework import Conversation

conversation = Conversation(system_prompt="You are helpful.")
conversation.add_user_message("Hello")
conversation.add_assistant_message("Hi!")

print(conversation.get_messages())
```

Internal events such as reasoning and text deltas are intentionally skipped when building messages for the LLM.

## Crews

Use `Crew` to connect multiple agents. The `entrypoint_agent` receives the user's input first. During initialization, agents are registered as tools on their peers:

- `delegate_to_agent_<name>` in normal delegation mode
- `ask_agent_<name>` when `only_ask_for_info=True`

```python
import asyncio
from agentic_framework import Agent, Crew
from agentic_framework.core.stream_events import ErrorEvent, FinalAnswerEvent, TextDeltaEvent
from agentic_framework.tools.base import tool


@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a city."""
    return f"Weather in {city}: rainy"


router = Agent(
    name="router",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    description="Routes work to specialists.",
)

weather_agent = Agent(
    name="weather_agent",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    description="Answers weather questions.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[router, weather_agent],
    entrypoint_agent=router,
    transfer_limit=5,
)


async def main() -> None:
    async for event in crew.invoke("What is the weather in Warsaw?"):
        if isinstance(event, TextDeltaEvent):
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif isinstance(event, FinalAnswerEvent):
            print(f"\nFinal answer from {event.agent_name}: {event.answer}")
        elif isinstance(event, ErrorEvent):
            print(f"\nError: {event.error}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

For a non-streaming crew response:

```python
answer = await crew.get_response("What is the weather in Warsaw?")
```

## Streaming Events

Agents and crews yield dataclass events from `agentic_framework.core.stream_events`:

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TextDeltaEvent` | A chunk of assistant text. |
| `ToolCallStartEvent` | A tool call is about to execute. |
| `ToolResultEvent` | A tool call completed or failed. |
| `DelegationEvent` | An agent delegated work to another agent. |
| `AskAgentEventResult` | An agent asked another agent for information. |
| `FinalAnswerEvent` | The agent produced its final answer. |
| `ErrorEvent` | A non-recoverable error occurred. |

## API Reference

### Agent

```python
Agent(
    name: str,
    model: str,
    description: str = "",
    system_prompt: str = "",
    can_delegate: bool = True,
    tools: list[BaseTool] = [],
    skills: list[Skill] = [],
    conversation: Conversation = Conversation(),
    max_iterations: int = 7,
    client: Any = default AsyncOpenAI client,
    tool_auto_choice: bool = False,
    crew: Crew | None = None,
    output_format: Any = None,
    reasoning_effort: str = "medium",
)
```

Useful methods:

- `stream(user_message: str)`: async generator of streaming events.
- `invoke(user_message: str) -> str`: returns the final answer string.
- `add_tool(tool: BaseTool | Agent)`: adds a tool, or registers an agent as a delegation/ask tool when part of a crew.
- `remove_tool(name: str) -> bool`: removes a tool by name.
- `list_tools() -> list[str]`: lists available tool names.
- `as_dict() -> dict`: serializes basic agent state.

### Crew

```python
Crew(
    agents: list[Agent],
    entrypoint_agent: Agent,
    delegate_to_agent: bool = True,
    only_ask_for_info: bool = False,
    shared_knowledge: bool = True,
    shared_identity: bool = False,
    conversation: Conversation = Conversation(),
    system_prompt: str = "...",
    transfer_limit: int = 5,
)
```

Useful methods:

- `invoke(input_message: str)`: async generator of crew events.
- `get_response(input_message: str) -> str`: returns the final answer string.
- `get_agent_by_name(name: str) -> Agent | None`: finds an agent in the crew.

### BaseTool

```python
BaseTool(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    func: Callable[..., Any] | None = None,
)
```

Useful methods:

- `execute(*args, **kwargs) -> Any`: calls the wrapped function.
- `to_openai_schema() -> dict`: returns an OpenAI-compatible function schema.

### Skill

```python
Skill(
    name: str,
    description: str,
    func: Callable[..., Any] | None = None,
    tools: list[BaseTool] = [],
)
```

`Skill` requires at least one tool and prefixes its name with `skill_` during initialization.

## Packaging And Releases

The package version lives in:

```python
agentic_framework/_version.py
```

To release a new version:

1. Update `__version__`.
2. Create a tag that matches the version, for example `v0.1.1`.
3. Publish a GitHub release for that tag.

The CI workflow runs tests and builds wheel/source distributions. The publish workflow checks that the release tag matches the package version before uploading to PyPI.

## Development

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Build the package:

```bash
python -m pip install build twine
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Runtime dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`

## Current Limitations

- There is no implemented memory API yet; `agentic_framework.core.memory` is currently empty.
- `agentic_framework.core.swarm` is currently empty.
- `tool_auto_choice`, `output_format`, and `shared_identity` are stored on the dataclasses but do not currently change runtime behavior.
